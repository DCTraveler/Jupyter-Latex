    "Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an essential early step in most data science projects and it often consists of taking the same steps to characterize a dataset (e.g. find out data types, missing information, distribution of values, correlations, etc.). Given the repetitiveness and similarity of such tasks, there are a few libraries that automate and help kickstart the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the latest is a new open-source Python library called Sweetviz (GitHub), created by a few contributors and myself for just that purpose. It takes pandas dataframes and creates a self-contained HTML report that can be viewed by itself in a browser or integrated into notebooks.\n",

    "It packs a powerful punch; in addition to creating insightful and beautiful visualizations with just two lines of code, it provides analysis that would take a lot more time to generate manually, including some that no other library provides so quickly such as:\n",
