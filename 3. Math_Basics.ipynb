Both issues are simply artifacts of the maths mode, in that it treats it as a mathematical expression: spaces are ignored (LaTeX spaces mathematics according to its own rules), and each character is a separate element (so are not positioned as closely as normal text).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways that text can be added properly. The typical way is to wrap the text with the \\text{...} command (a similar command is \\mbox{...}, though this causes problems with subscripts, and has a less descriptive name). Let's see what happens when the above equation code is adapted:\n",

    "### Formatted text\n",
    "Using the \\text is fine and gets the basic result. Yet, there is an alternative that offers a little more flexibility. You may recall the introduction of font formatting commands, such as \\textrm, \\textit, \\textbf, etc. These commands format the argument accordingly, e.g., \\textbf{bold text} gives bold text. These commands are equally valid within a maths environment to include text. The added benefit here is that you can have better control over the font formatting, rather than the standard text achieved with \\text.\n",
