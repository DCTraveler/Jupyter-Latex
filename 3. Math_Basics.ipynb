When two maths elements appear on either side of the sign, it is assumed to be a binary operator, and as such, allocates some space to either side of the sign. The alternative way is a sign designation. This is when you state whether a mathematical quantity is either positive or negative. This is common for the latter, as in math, such elements are assumed to be positive unless a âˆ’ is prefixed to it. In this instance, you want the sign to appear close to the appropriate element to show their association. If you put a + or a âˆ’ with nothing before it but you want it to be handled like a binary operator you can add an invisible character before the operator using {}. This can be useful if you are writing multiple-line formulas, and a new line could start with a âˆ’ or +, for example, then you can fix some strange alignments adding the invisible character where necessary.\n",

The result tends to be slightly incorrect horizontal spacing. In these events, the output is still satisfactory, yet any perfectionists will no doubt wish to fine-tune their formulas to ensure spacing is correct. These are generally very subtle adjustments.\n",

Let us use an example: you want the d of a dx in an integral to be in roman font and a small space away from the rest.

If you change your mind, you just have to change the definition in the preamble, and all your integrals will be changed accordingly.\n",
