For Lesson 7 Hands-On, you have three scenarios.  It will be your job to determine which type of *t*-test to use for each scenario. Then, conduct your chosen test, following all the steps of hypothesis testing, as taught in Lesson 6 and re-iterated on page 5 of the current lesson.  `This Hands-­On will go towards your grade` so be sure you complete all requirements.

Steps of Hypothesis Testing:

* State the null and alternative hypothesis.

* For the Single Sample t-test and Dependent t-test: calculate the test statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value. For Independent t-test: calculate the p-value.

* Assess the statistical significance by comparing the *p*-value to the α-level.

* Show the appropriate connections between the numerical and graphical summaries that support the hypothesis test.

* Draw a correct conclusion for the hypothesis test.

## Requirements

For all tests, use a two-tailed test and an α-level cut-off of .05 to indicate significance.

### Scenario #1 

A linguist wants to compare the occurrence of nouns in two of his favorite Shakespeare plays, *As You Like It* and *Julius Caesar.* He counts them all, stores them in **[this dataset](https://repo.exeterlms.com/documents/V2/DataScience/Basic-Statistics/shakespeare.zip)** and wants to know if the number of nouns in the two plays differ from each other.  

Which type of *t*-test should you conduct? 

-Single Sample *t*-test

-Dependent *t*-test

-Independent *t* test

### Scenario #2 

A meteorologist measures the highest temperature of every major city in Texas on one of the hottest days in the summer, as shown in **[this dataset](https://repo.exeterlms.com/documents/V2/DataScience/Basic-Statistics/TXtemperatures.zip)**.  He then wants to know how the highest temperature in Denton compares to the entire population.
