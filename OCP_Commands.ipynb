    "\n",
    "```oc get pods --selector deploymentconfig=blog```\n",
    "\n",
    "You only have one instance of the application so only one pod will be listed, similar to:\n",

    "\n",
    "To make it easier to reference the name of the pod in these instructions, we define here a shell function to capture the name so it can be stored in an environment variable. That environment variable will then be used in the commands you run.\n",

    "\n",
    "```pod() { local selector=$1; local query='?(@.status.phase==\"Running\")'; oc get pods --selector $selector -o jsonpath=\"{.items[$query].metadata.name}\"; }```\n",

    "\n",
    "As already noted it is not possible to copy a single file, so we indicate that the current directory should be copied, but use the --exclude=* option to first say that all files should be ignored when performing the copy. That pattern is then overridden for just the robots.txt file by using the --include=robots.txt file, ensuring the robots.txt file is copied.\n",
    "\n",
    "When copying files to the container, it is required that the directory into which files are being copied exists, and that it is writable to the user or group that the container is being run as. Permissions on directories and files should be set as part of the process of building the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above command, the --no-perms option is also used because the target directory in the container, although writable by the group the container is run as, is owned by a different user to that which the container is run as. This means that although files can be added to the directory, permissions on existing directories cannot be changed. The --no-perms options tells oc rsync to not attempt to update permissions to avoid it failing and returning errors.\n",

    "oc rsync . $POD:/opt/app-root/src/htdocs --no-perms\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Topic 4 - Synchronizing Files with a Container\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being able to manually upload or download files when you choose to, the oc rsync command can also be set up to perform live synchronization of files between your local computer and the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the file system of your local computer will be monitored for any changes made to files. When there is a change to a file, the changed file will be automatically copied up to the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "This same process can also be run in the opposite direction if required, with changes made in the container being automatically copied back to your local computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of where it can be useful to have changes automatically copied from your local computer into the container is during the development of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "For scripted programming languages such as PHP, Python or Ruby, where no separate compilation phase is required, provided that the web server can be manually restarted without causing the container to exit, or if the web server always reloads code files which have been modified, you can perform live code development with your application running inside of OpenShift.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this ability, clone the Git repository for the web application which you have already deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/openshift-katacoda/blog-django-py\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a sub directory blog-django-py containing the source code for the application:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "oc rsh $POD kill -HUP 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will have the affect of sending a HUP signal to process ID 1 running within the container, which is the instance of mod_wsgi-express which is running. This will trigger the required restart and reloading of the application, but without the web server actually exiting.\n",

    "\n",
    "Manually forcing a restart of the web server application processes will get the job done, but a better way is if the web server can automatically detect code changes and trigger a restart.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of mod_wsgi-express and how this web application has been configured, this can be enabled by setting an environment variable for the deployment. To set this environment variable run:\n",
    "\n",
    "oc set env dc/blog MOD_WSGI_RELOAD_ON_CHANGES=1\n",

    "\n",
    "Refresh the web site page again, multiple times if need be, until the title banner shows as green. The change may not be immediate as the file synchronization may take a few moments, as may the detection of the code changes and restart of the web server application process.\n",

    "\n",

    "Although one can synchronize files from the local computer into a container in this way, whether you can use it as a mechanism for enabling live coding will depend on the programming language being used, and the web application stack being used. This was possible for Python when using mod_wsgi-express, but may not be possible with other WSGI servers for Python, or other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do note that even for the case of Python, this can only be used where modifying code files. If you need to install additional Python packages, you would need to re-build the application from the original source code.

    "## Topic 5 - Copying Files to a Persistent Volume\n",
    "If you are mounting a persistent volume into the container for your application and you need to copy files into it, then oc rsync can be used in the same way as described previously to upload files. All you need to do is supply as the target directory, the path of where the persistent volume is mounted in the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't as yet deployed your application, but are wanting to prepare in advance a persistent volume with all the data it needs to contain, you can still claim a persistent volume and upload the data to it. In order to do this, you will though need to deploy a dummy application against which the persistent volume can be mounted.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a dummy application for this purpose run the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "oc run dummy --image centos/httpd-24-centos7\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the oc run command as it creates just a deployment configuration and managed pod. A service is not created as we don't actually need the application we are running here, an instance of the Apache HTTPD server in this case, to actually be contactable. We are using the Apache HTTPD server purely as a means of keeping the pod running.\n",
    "\n",
    "To monitor the startup of the pod and ensure it is deployed, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "oc rollout status dc/dummy\n",

    "\n",
    "oc get all --selector run=dummy -o name\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a running application, we next need to claim a persistent volume and mount it against our dummy application.
